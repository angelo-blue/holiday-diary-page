# holiday-diary-page
Simple blog-like offline html page

Keeping a diary of holidays and travels - what format should I use?  In particular, I'm thinking long term - I want this to be accessible in 10 or 20 years time.  


My requirements are:

- looks good on a laptop, tablet, or phone.  

- a blog-like look.  That is, text and photos, vertically scrolling.

- a very, very simple structure.  I may want to convert these to a different format in ten years time.

- offline storage.

- no special tools required to edit or view.  

- able to transport/send/email.  


In the end I went for a html with embedded css, and images in subfolders.  The source is a bit uglier than I'd like due to the html tags, but if I keep to the simple format it's not too bad.  If Markdown was native and standard that would have been ideal - sadly, no.
